# Fitness-Dashboard
This project uses Power BI to analyze wearable fitness data and track sleep, recovery, and strain. Data was cleaned in Power Query, modeled using a date table, and analyzed with DAX measures. Interactive dashboards with KPIs, charts, and slicers provide insights into recovery trends, overtraining, and sleep impact.
